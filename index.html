    <p>Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology conglomerate headquartered in Redmond,
        Washington.[2] Founded in 1975, the company became highly influential in the rise of personal computers through
        software like Windows, and the company has since expanded to Internet services, cloud computing, video gaming
        and other fields. Microsoft is the largest software maker, one of the most valuable public U.S. companies,[a]
        and one of the most valuable brands globally.</p>
    <p>luable brands globally.

        Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800.
        It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by
        Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three
        billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has
        increasingly diversified from the operating system market. Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000 which
        would see the then-largest of Microsoft's corporate acquisitions in Skype Technologies in 2011,[3] and an
        increased focus on hardware[4][5] that led to its first in-house PC line, the Surface, in 2012, and the
        formation of Microsoft Mobile through Nokia. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has
        changed focus towards cloud computing,[6][7] as well as its large acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in
        2016.[8] Under Nadella's direction, the company has also expanded its video gaming business to support the Xbox
        brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022, which is currently[b] the third-largest gaming
        company in the world by revenue,[9] following the 2023 acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion.[10]

    <h2>History</h2>

    <b>1972–1985: Founding
    </b>
    <p>Childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business using their skills in computer programming.[12] In 1972, they founded Traf-O-Data, which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates enrolled at Harvard University while Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State University, though he later dropped out to work at Honeywell.[13] The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer,[14] which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a demonstration. Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.[11]: 108, 112–114  Gates and Allen established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO,[15] and Allen suggested the name "Micro-Soft", short for micro-computer software.[16][17] In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office of ASCII Microsoft.[18] Microsoft moved its headquarters to Bellevue, Washington, in January 1979.[15]
